# Trackmania Menu Bg Chooser

This let's you choose the main menu background. You can choose from:

* A custom time of day (morning, day, evening, or night).
* A custom png, jpg, or webm file (via URL)
* TMX monthly backgrounds (either the current month or a random month)

To return to normal, select "Disabled" in settings and then restart Trackmania (sorry, it's a lot more work to avoid this).
